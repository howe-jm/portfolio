        <h3>Hello! I'm Jason.</h3>
        <h4>I'm a web developer from Columbus, Ohio.</h4>
        <p>After almost 10 years as a truck driver, I decided I need to make a change in my life and my career. I have always had a passion for technology and computers, but have had very few opportunities to translate that passion in to a career until now.
        </p>          

        <p>Thanks to Thinkful, I will be able to fully dedicate myself to learning and preparing to enter the job market in the tech industry. From there, I will continue to build my knowledge and portfolio, meet and network with new people, and expand my opportunities.
        </p>
          
        <p>After Thinkful, I hope to move on to learning more about development and cybersecurity. I hope to learn to work with React, Ruby, and other in-demand libraries and languages as I continue my career in coding.</p>

        <p>Hey, there!</p>

        <p>I'm currently a truck driver and soon to be studying with Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program.</p>
        
        <p>I'm interested in learning to code not just for work, but for side projects and hobbies I've always been interested in pursuing, but have never had the chance to!</p>
        
        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy movies and TV shows, reading, gaming, scuba diving, cooking, and learning about other cultures (Especially food!). I try to learn new things every day, and I'm at my best when I'm laughing while I do it. I love to be around people, and I always try to make sure everyone around me is engaged and having a good time.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
